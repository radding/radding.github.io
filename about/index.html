              <p>
                Hey there! Let me introduce myself while you are here. My name is Yoseph Radding, and I an entrepreneur and 
                software engineer. If you are interested in building great products, entrepreneurship, and technologies, then you 
                came to the right place.

              <h3>How did I get to where I am today?</h3>
              <p>
                This is a great question! I like to think I have rather unique story.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started out as a kid who enjoyed building and creating as a child. I remember, when I was about six or seven, 
                building a a "deer pen" out of fallen tree limbs, nails and rope at my father's friend's house on martha's 
                vineyard. However, I still didn't really know what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, just like anyother kid.
                However, that all changed when I entered high school.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most people have a teacher or friend that really helped define them. For me, it was my high school. I went to 
                Aviation High School in Sunnyside Queens, NY, a specialized high school for aircraft maintenance. It was here that 
                I fell in love with troubleshooting and engineering. I learned so many invaluable skills here. To this day, I annoy
                everyone I work with by rambling on about how airplanes work and cool trivia facts about planes. Because of Aviation,
                I decided to study to become an engineer.
              </p>
              <p>
                But my story doesn't stop there!
              </p>
              <p>
                It wasn't until college, when I cofounded my first startup, 
                that I truly realized what I love doing. The entire process of building the product and scaling the business was 
                an amazing experience that I relish to this day. I fell in love with entrepreneurship with LykeMe. Since then
                I founded another business and I hope to found many more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, more than three years after founding LykeMe, I am hoping to make an impact in the Detroit startup space. I am
                a 2017 Hackerfellow working for SPLT in Detroit. Here's to startups and the growing ecosystem in Detroit!
